I am a recent Electrical Engineering graduate from Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. I have now started my career as a Junior Software Engineer at Intelligent Artifacts in the NYC area. In my off time, I continue to pursue my passions in Hardware Design using Chisel and FPGA devices. In the future I hope to provide a complete GUI to assist users in getting started with the Chipyard SoC Design framework.
