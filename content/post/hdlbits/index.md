Recently I've been attempting to improve my HDL skills, and in going through the related files for the CMU Computer Architecture course (see previous post), I found a very good website for recieving extra practice. [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) has over 100 short exercises that all compile in your browser, and many with sample solutions that show an optimal way to code an exercise (to improve your efficiency). Highly Recommended.
