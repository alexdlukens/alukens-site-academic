Just went out for some nighttime city shots, and I am thoroughly impressed with the camera experience on the iPhone 12 Pro. I mainly utilized the "night mode" which just does a long exposure, and it performed very well. Apple automatically adjusts the exposure time based on how it perceives the environment (ranging from 1 second to 30 seconds). I fooled the camera into exposing for longer on one photo, and it wasn't necessarily better, just brighter.
