I have recently found an archived playlist of lectures for Computer Architecture from Carnegie Mellon University from 2015, seems to be very informational. The only downside is that I cannot expect/receive active feedback and involvement from the faculty member who taught that course. It is still a very great starting point to expand my knowledge on datapath and ISA specification. The youtube playlist can be found [here][playlist_link]
