In an honest effort to improve the quality of my reports, I have decided to switch my report format to incorporate the LaTeX coding language. This will drastically improve the quality of my reports, and prepare me for future technical writing for research papers and my thesis. With my current knowledge of LaTeX, the reports are taking considerably longer to produce, but I believe that in time my speed will increase.
