This is the second of a group of three related laboratory projects. In this laboratory, I continued to advance on the CMOS carry-ripple adder design created in the previous laboratory session. Specifically, I utilized Cadence Virtuoso to create a layout cellview for the the full adder schematic design implemented in the previous laboratory session. This layout will be completed by hand, and will require the use of several metal layers and vias to create the interconnect between transistors. Design rule checking and Layout versus Schematic testing will be utilized to affirm the functionality of the cell.
