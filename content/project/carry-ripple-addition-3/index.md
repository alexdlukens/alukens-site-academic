This laboratory is the final of a series of three related laboratory sessions. In this laboratory, I elaborated on the ripple adder design created in Cadence Virtuoso during the previous two laboratory sessions. Specifically, I instantiated 4 instances of the full adder layout created in the previous laboratory session, and connected these cells together to create a 4-bit ripple adder. Additionally, a schematic and symbol cellview were created for this 4-bit ripple adder that allows this design to be utilized in more complex designs. Design rule checking and layout versus schematic verification were performed on this design to ensure correctness and proper functionality. This design itself can be instantiated multiple times to create an even larger ripple adder.
