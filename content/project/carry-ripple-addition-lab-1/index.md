In this laboratory I designed and tested the schematic cellview for a single-bit mirror adder in Cadence Virtuoso. This design was exported into a netlist and compared for functionality against a verilog file implementing the functionality of a full-adder. The rising and falling propagation delays of the carry-out bit were then examined and plotted. In future laboratory sessions, a layout cellview for the full adder will be implemented, and multiple instances of the cell will be utilized to create a 4-bit ripple adder.
